<h1 id="toc_0">Getting A Token</h1>

<p>Administrators can generate tokens to access the API via the Security &gt; API section of the admin application. Note, tokens generated by this mechanism will have the permissions of the user who generated them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>API tokens are currently an early-access feature and need to be enabled by <a href="https://support.okta.com">Okta support</a>.  If you don&#39;t see the API section then your organization has not been enabled for API access.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="toc_1">Token Expiration</h2>

<p>Okta uses a bearer token for API authentication with a sliding scale expiration.  Tokens are valid for 30 days and automatically refresh with each API call.  Tokens that are not used for 30 days will expire.  The token lifetime is currently fixed and cannot be changed for your organization. </p>
