## Release 2017.03

### Advance Notice: API Rate Limit Improvements

In the coming months, Okta will improve how API rate limits are reported, and how they are enforced.

* Shortly after February 8, 2017, we'll provide system log alerts to let you know that you exceeded an API rate limit. At this time, we'll change some rate limits.
* Shortly after March 8, 2017, rate limits will be enforced.

Of course, as each change is released, we'll announced here.
